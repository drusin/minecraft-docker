## Usage
Forward the port 25565 and mount a read/write volume to `/data`, to persist worlds and server settings. If the volume already contains worlds, config files or plugins/mods the server will use those and they will be updated during runtime. It is not possible to change server config using environment variables, please use the regular server config files in the volume.

### Forge specific information

For configuring Forge it is necessary to find out, which Forge Version is currently available for your desired Minecraft version.
Here you can check the Forge versions: http://files.minecraftforge.net/.
In most cases the recommended version (right one) will fit. This depends on the mods you are using.

Currently (2020-11-26) Forge is not compatible with Java 15.

## Auto pause functionality
By setting `AUTO_PAUSE` to `"true"`, every 5 min it will be checked if anyone is connected to the server. If noone is, the server process will be stopped and will not consume any processor resources anymore. As soon as someone tries to connect, the server process will be continued - this should work seamlessly, without the players even noticing. This functionality is based on [this comment on the official Mojang bug tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149018?focusedCommentId=593606&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-593606).  
**Important:** By default the minecraft server is set to crash if no ticks are happening for 60s. If you want to use auto pause you need to disable this functionality by setting `max-tick-time=-1` in `server.properties`, `timeout-time: -1` and `restart-on-crash: false` in `spigot.yaml` (if appliacable). Also there is a grace period before the first check for online players to make sure the server is fully started. You can change the amount of time with the `BEFORE_FIRST_PAUSE` environment variable.

## Example docker-compose
